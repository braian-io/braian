Braian is an open-source product data system for the work a PIM usually covers. You host it yourself. It has a keyboard-first interface, and the same operations are available over the API and MCP, so an agent acts as a person in the session.

Postgres is the source of truth and the change log. Search, live updates, and outbound events follow from `changes`. The design is in [docs/events.md](docs/events.md).

## Features

- An agent in the session: it acts with your permissions, and every change is a proposal you can accept, review, or undo.
- A data model you define: entities, typed attributes, languages, and references. Nothing is locked to a product type.
- A headless API and MCP. The same change stream reaches open UIs over SSE and other systems over webhooks.
- Live updates in the interface.
- Search through Typesense.
- Multilingual attribute values.
- A keyboard-first UI. Ctrl+K runs the same operations as the screen.

## Architecture

Writers share one operation layer. Commits land in Postgres and append to `changes`. Interactive and bulk are separate lanes on that table, so a fast edit is claimed while a bulk range is still open. The indexer updates Typesense. Search returns to the UI. `LISTEN braian_changes` wakes the SSE tail, including commits from another process. The routes are `GET /v1/stream` and `/v1/webhooks`.

One binary, `braian`, runs the server roles. In development, `braian all` migrates, seeds, and runs the API and the indexer together. In production, run each role as its own process.

## Quick start

You need Docker, Rust 1.93, Node 22, pnpm 10, and [just](https://just.systems/). CI uses the free GitHub runners.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
just up
pnpm install
just dev
```

`just up` starts Postgres and Typesense. `pnpm install` is once, before Vite can start. `just dev` (or `pnpm dev` / `npm run dev` from the repo root) runs migrations, synthetic demo data, the API, the indexer, and the web app. The first run compiles Rust; later backend edits rebuild when [cargo-watch](https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch) is installed (`cargo install cargo-watch` on native Windows). Set `BRAIAN_DEV_NO_WATCH=1` to run the backend once without watch. Stop with Ctrl+C.

- Web: http://127.0.0.1:3000
- API: http://127.0.0.1:8090
- Host ports, from `compose.yaml`: Postgres `5433`, Typesense `8108`

The demo account is created from `BRAIAN_DEMO_EMAIL` and `BRAIAN_DEMO_PASSWORD` in `.env`. See `.env.example`. Those values are not in the source tree. Without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the Ctrl+K panel says that no model is connected. Proposals, bulk edits, and undo still work. The catalog is synthetic. Its size is `BRAIAN_SEED_COUNT`. Tests do not write that database.

`scripts/reset-demo-db.sh` drops and recreates that demo database. Run it only by hand, after an explicit decision. It is not part of deploy, CI, or any systemd unit. Pass `--yes`. Stop `braian`, `braian-web`, and `braian-autodeploy.timer` first (`braian` uses `Restart=always`). Where `systemctl` exists, the script checks those units and exits if any is active. It also exits if `pg_stat_activity` shows another session on the database. It does not terminate sessions.

The script reads `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or from `.env`. Allowed database names are `braian`, `braian_dev`, and `braian_test` (`BRAIAN_RESET_ALLOWED_DBS` replaces that list). A name matching `braian-perf-*-stack` is always refused. The host must be `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, the selected container name, or an entry in `BRAIAN_RESET_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (`host` or `host:port`).

On the demo host, Postgres is the container `braian-postgres-1` (`postgres:18`) and the host has no client tools. `--container`, or `BRAIAN_PG_CONTAINER`, selects the container (that name is the default when it is running). `pg_dump`, the session check, `dropdb`, and `createdb` run with `docker exec`. The dump is streamed to a file on the host. Inside the container the client connects to `127.0.0.1:5432`. Without a container, `pg_dump`, `psql`, `dropdb`, and `createdb` must be local major version 18.

The backup is written under `BRAIAN_BACKUP_DIR` (default `./backups`) with `umask 077`, so the directory is `0700` and the file is `0600`. The script stops if the backup fails. Seed uses `BRAIAN_BIN`, or `target/release/braian` when that file is executable, and otherwise `cargo run -p braian-server -- seed`. `braian seed` applies migrations on connect, loads the catalog, and reindexes when `TYPESENSE_URL` and `TYPESENSE_API_KEY` are set. The script does not call `braian reindex` again.

On Windows, install just with `winget install --id Casey.Just` or `scoop install just`. Without it, `.\scripts\up.ps1` and `.\scripts\dev.ps1` do the same work. A WSL2 checkout on the Linux filesystem is faster than a bind mount from `C:\`. More detail is in [docs/dev.md](docs/dev.md).

### Checks

```bash
just check
just test
```

`just demo-4` runs the change-log tests and needs Postgres. `just demo-5` needs Typesense. Both services come from `just up`. For the web app, `pnpm --dir apps/web typecheck` and `pnpm --dir apps/web test`. `node scripts/e2e.mjs` runs the browser smoke against the database `braian_e2e` and needs Postgres and Typesense from `just up`. `just --list` prints every recipe.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the placeholders. `.env` is gitignored. Names only:

| Group | Variables |
| --- | --- |
| Infrastructure | `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_READONLY_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URI`, `TYPESENSE_URL`, `TYPESENSE_API_KEY` |
| Processes | `BRAIAN_API_ADDR`, `BRAIAN_SEARCH_ALIAS`, `BRAIAN_COOKIE_SECURE`, `RUST_LOG` |
| Pools and bulk | `BRAIAN_POOL_INTERACTIVE`, `BRAIAN_POOL_BULK`, `BRAIAN_BULK_YIELD_MS`, `BRAIAN_BULK_YIELD_STEP_MS`, `BRAIAN_BULK_YIELD_MAX_MS`, `BRAIAN_BULK_JOBS`, `BRAIAN_BULK_QUEUE`, `BRAIAN_BULK_CHUNK` |
| Indexer | `BRAIAN_INDEXER_POOL`, `BRAIAN_INDEXER_BATCH`, `BRAIAN_INDEXER_IMPORT_BATCH`, `BRAIAN_INDEXER_IMPORT_CONCURRENCY`, `BRAIAN_INDEXER_BULK_BATCH`, `BRAIAN_INDEXER_BULK_IMPORT_BATCH`, `BRAIAN_INDEXER_BULK_IMPORT_CONCURRENCY`, `BRAIAN_INDEXER_BULK_YIELD_MAX_MS` |
| Demo and tokens | `BRAIAN_DEV_TOKENS`, `BRAIAN_DEMO_EMAIL`, `BRAIAN_DEMO_PASSWORD`, `BRAIAN_DEMO_TOKEN`, `BRAIAN_SEED_COUNT` |
| Agent | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `BRAIAN_AGENT_MODEL`, `BRAIAN_AGENT_MOCK` |
| In-app feedback | `BRAIAN_FEEDBACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `BRAIAN_FEEDBACK_WEBHOOK_HEADER`, `BRAIAN_FEEDBACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `BRAIAN_FEEDBACK_DIR` |
| Tests | `BRAIAN_TEST_DATABASE_URL` |

`BRAIAN_COOKIE_SECURE` belongs on only behind HTTPS. Comments and local placeholders are in `.env.example`. An old `KAFKA_BROKERS` value is ignored. The change log is described in [docs/events.md](docs/events.md).

In-app feedback stays off until `BRAIAN_FEEDBACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is set, and only an admin can send it. `BRAIAN_FEEDBACK_WEBHOOK_HEADER` is either a full header line (`Authorization: Bearer …`), split on the first colon, or only the header name. In the name-only form, `BRAIAN_FEEDBACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is the value. An invalid header name or value stops the API at startup, and that error does not include the value. Screenshots and the client log are files under `BRAIAN_FEEDBACK_DIR` (default `./data/feedback`). The webhook receives those paths, not the file contents.

Measured figures, with hardware, data size, and the command that produced them, are in [docs/measurements/](docs/measurements/). This page does not repeat them. What is still unmeasured is called out in those notes and in [docs/status.md](docs/status.md).
